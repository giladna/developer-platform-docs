title: Getting Started With the Player SDK for Android
weight: 110
---

This guide will walk you through the steps for adding a Kaltura video player to your Android mobile application, using the Kaltura Player. The library is a super-collection of all Kaltura Playkit libraries, which include the [Player](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-android), Kaltura [Analytics](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-android-kava), and various [Providers](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-android-providers) that can access the Kaltura Backend. Using the Kaltura Player library makes it easier to take advantage of all player capabilities. 

In this Kotlin tutorial,  you'll learn how to import the Kaltura Player SDK, find the necessary credentials, and load the player with your Entry ID of choice. **Because the player is focused on performance and giving you the simplest integration possible, it does not contain a UI.** That being said, this guide will show you how to listen to events in order to manage the player state, as well as examples for adding play/pause buttons and a slider to the player.

## Before You Begin

You'll need two things:

1. Your Kaltura Partner ID, which can be found in the KMC under Settings>Integration Settings
2. Any video entry, which can be found in the KMC as well.

## Setting Up OVP Player

Begin by creating a new project in Android Studio. For this guide we chose the Fullscreen Activity Preset, to make it simpler to view the player in full-screen.

The `FullScreenActivity.kt` comes pre-loaded with functions for showing and hiding the Action Bar and the Controls menu, to achieve the full-screen functionality.

## Compile Options

Depending on your Compile Settings, you might get an error about Invoke-customs or supported release versions. In that case should add java 1.8 to your compile options in `build.gradle`

{% highlight gradle %}
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28
    android {
        compileOptions {
            sourceCompatibility 1.8
            targetCompatibility 1.8
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}

### Dependencies

In your `build.gradle` add the Kaltura-Player dependency:

{% highlight gradle %}
implementation 'com.kaltura.player:tvplayer:4.x.x'
{% endhighlight %}

[tvplayer releases](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-player-android/releases)

### Appication/Splash Activity
KalturaOvpPlayer should be initialized in the application class or in a splash activity before using the player.

```
KalturaOvpPlayer.initialize(this, OVP_PARTNER_ID, OVP_SERVER_URL)
``` 

### Imports 

In the `FullScreenActivity.kt`, import the following: 

{% highlight kotlin %}
import com.kaltura.playkit.PlayerState
import com.kaltura.tvplayer.KalturaPlayer
import com.kaltura.tvplayer.OVPMediaOptions
import com.kaltura.tvplayer.PlayerInitOptions
{% endhighlight %}

### Constants 

Static variables in `Kotlin` are placed in the `Companion` Object, which acts as an inner singleton class that gives access to its members as direct members of the class. 

In our Companion Object, we'll declare the log-tag and Partner ID:

{% highlight kotlin %}
companion object {
    private const val TAG = "FullscreenActivity"
    public const val OVP_SERVER_URL = "https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com"
    public const val PARTNER_ID = 2215841
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Class Variables 

For starters you'll need the ID of the entry, or video, that you want to display in the player. You can find this in the KMC under [Content](https://kmc.kaltura.com/index.php/kmcng/content/entries/list). 

You'll need an object for the Player, and you'll also need to hold onto the Player State (for playing and pausing):

{% highlight kotlin %}
private val entryId = "1_w9zx2eti"
private var player: KalturaPlayer? = null
private var playerState: PlayerState? = null
{% endhighlight %}

## The Player 

Create a new function called `loadPlaykitPlayer`. This function will: 
1. Set configuration and behavior (auto-play set to True)
2. Initialize the player 
3. Create a view that is determined by the size of the player using `fullscreen_content` object that was created by the Fullscreen preset 
4. Load the media entry inside the player using OVP Provider Object 
5. Use built in Log object to document an error if loading the entry fails
6. Set the global Player to the new one if nothing fails 
7. Call `addPlayerStateListener` function
   
{% highlight kotlin %}
private fun loadPlaykitPlayer() {

    val playerInitOptions = PlayerInitOptions(PARTNER_ID) //player config/behavior
    playerInitOptions.setAutoPlay(true)

    val player = KalturaOvpPlayer.create(this@FullscreenActivity, playerInitOptions) ?: return

    player.setPlayerView(FrameLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT, FrameLayout.LayoutParams.WRAP_CONTENT)

    fullscreen_content.addView(player.playerView)

    val ovpMediaOptions = buildOvpMediaOptions()
    player.loadMedia(ovpMediaOptions) { entry, loadError ->
        if (loadError != null) {
            Snackbar.make(findViewById(android.R.id.content), loadError.message, Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG).show()
        } else {
            Log.d(tag, "OVPMedia onEntryLoadComplete  entry = " + entry.id)
        }
    }
    this.player = player
    addPlayerStateListener()
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Provider Options 

The provider helps the player access the Kaltura backend. The entryId is checked against the API, and there is an option to pass a Kaltura Session, which is always recommended when creating a player. If your application doesn't already generate a Kaltura Session, read [this](https://developer.kaltura.com/api-docs/VPaaS-API-Getting-Started/how-to-create-kaltura-session.html) to learn more. 

Create a function called `buildOvpMediaOptions`. The `apply` keyword in Kotlin will run the code block and pass the *receiver*, or in this case, `mediaOptions` as **`this`**. 

{% highlight kotlin %} 
private fun buildOvpMediaOptions(): OVPMediaOptions {
    val mediaOptions = OVPMediaOptions().apply {
        entryId = myEntryId
        ks = null
    }
{% endhighlight %}

### State Listener

Create another function called `addPlayerStateListener`. It sets the state of the player any time it changes and logs the state change. 

{% highlight kotlin %} 
private fun addPlayerStateListener() {
    player!!.addListener<PlayerEvent.StateChanged>(this, PlayerEvent.stateChanged) { event ->
        Log.d(TAG, "State changed from " + event.oldState + " to " + event.newState)
        playerState = event.newState
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

### onCreate 

Let's put all the pieces together. In the `onCreate` function, you'll need to call the functions we just created: 

{% highlight kotlin %}
    loadPlaykitPlayer()
    addPlayPauseButton()
{% endhighlight %}

We removed the `setOnTouchListner` for the button, and ended up with something that looks like this:

{% highlight kotlin %}
override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

    setContentView(R.layout.activity_fullscreen)
    supportActionBar?.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true)

    mVisible = true

    loadPlaykitPlayer()
    addPlayPauseButton()
    
    fullscreen_content.setOnClickListener { toggle() }
}
{% endhighlight %}

If you run the app now, you should see the player, and your video should start automatically. If you turn off the screen lock, you'll see that the video becomes fullscreen and that the buttons disappear. Notice however that you have no way of pausing the video. We'll need play and pause buttons. 


### Play and Pause 

The Fullscreen project has already created two buttons for us. In this example we removed one of the buttons and called the other one playPauseButton. We also turned it into an imageButton (instead of text) so that we can use proper images from the Exo image library that we imported earlier. 

{% highlight xml %}
 <ImageButton
    android:layout_width="0dp"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content" app:srcCompat="@drawable/exo_controls_play"
    android:id="@+id/playPauseButton" android:layout_weight="1" android:background="#00FFFFFF"/>
{% endhighlight %}

The `addPlayPauseButton` sets the button to rely on Player state in order to know which image to show. Meaning if the video is playing, the button should show a *pause* icon, and when the button is clicked, the video pauses and the image turns to a *play* icon. 

{% highlight kotlin %}
private fun addPlayPauseButton() {
    
    playPauseButton!!.setOnClickListener { v ->
        if (player != null) {
            if (player!!.isPlaying) {
                //If player is playing, change text of the button and pause.
                player!!.pause()
                playPauseButton!!.setImageResource(R.drawable.exo_controls_play)
            } else {
                //If player is not playing, change text of the button and play.
                player!!.play()
                playPauseButton!!.setImageResource(R.drawable.exo_controls_pause)
            }
        }
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We made a few other changes to the activity XML, like turning the view into a `LinearLayout`. See full XML: 

{% highlight xml %}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<FrameLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
            xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto" xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"
            android:layout_width="match_parent"
            android:layout_height="match_parent"
            android:background="#0099cc"
            tools:context=".FullscreenActivity">

<LinearLayout android:id="@+id/fullscreen_content"
                android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"
                android:keepScreenOn="true"
                android:gravity="center" android:orientation="horizontal"/>

<FrameLayout android:layout_width="match_parent"
                android:layout_height="match_parent"
                android:fitsSystemWindows="true">

    <LinearLayout android:id="@+id/fullscreen_content_controls"
                    style="?metaButtonBarStyle"
                    android:layout_width="match_parent"
                    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
                    android:layout_gravity="bottom|center_horizontal"
                    android:background="@color/black_overlay"
                    android:orientation="horizontal"
                    tools:ignore="UselessParent">

        <ImageButton
                android:layout_width="0dp"
                android:layout_height="wrap_content" app:srcCompat="@drawable/exo_controls_play"
                android:id="@+id/playPauseButton" android:layout_weight="1" android:background="#00FFFFFF"/>
    </LinearLayout>
</FrameLayout>

</FrameLayout>
{% endhighlight %}

### Gradle Dependencies for Playkit SDK 

##### A. Kaltura Player: 
This dependency can be used on client app side. If client app use this then *there is no need to use Playkit, Kava, DTG and Providers dependency separately*. Because it is inbuilt in Kaltura Player.
Find more [here](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-player-android/blob/develop/README.md)

`implementation 'com.kaltura.player:tvplayer:kaltura_player_version'`

Please check our [Kaltura Player samples](https://github.com/kaltura/kaltura-player-android-samples/blob/8c743c7083ec2848cc0db979a194b9c92ce1a36b/AdvancedSamples/FullDemo/playkitdemo/build.gradle#L34)

#####B. Use Player components standalone: 
If client app wants to use player and its plugins standalone then other dependecies should be added.Find more [here](https://kaltura.github.io/playkit/guide/android/)

Please check our [Playkit Samples](https://github.com/kaltura/playkit-android-samples/blob/fd33d9709396fce6c4df983fc5efe7652fd1427b/FullDemo/app/build.gradle#L29)

`implementation 'com.kaltura.playkit:playkit:latest_version'`
##### 2. DTG (Download To Go):
Plugin which handles download of dash(including DRM) and hls streams(clear streams)
`implementation 'com.kaltura.dtg:dtglib:dtg_latest_version'`
##### 3. Phoenix Provider Plugin: 
If you are Kaltura customer then this plugin which handles Kaltura OTT and OVP BE api calls.
`implementation 'com.kaltura.playkit:playkitproviders:latest_version'`

If client apps want to exclude the playkit from other plugins in case they find any cyclic dependency issue on app side then simply it can exclude the tree from the relavant dependency.

######Example
```
implementation 'com.kaltura.playkit:anyPlugin:latest_version', {
exclude group: 'com.kaltura.playkit', module: 'playkit'
}

```
